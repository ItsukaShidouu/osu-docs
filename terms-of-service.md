## Terms of Service

_Last updated: 13 September 2025_

### 1. Introduction  
Welcome to **osunolimits.dev**, a private osu! game server operated by **Marc Andre Herpers** (“we,” “our,” “us”).  
By creating an account or using any of our services, you accept these Terms.  
If you do not agree, please discontinue use.

### 2. Services  
We provide a private osu! game server and related features such as account creation, gameplay statistics, and leaderboards.

### 3. Personal Data We Process  
To operate the service we process only the data required for gameplay, security, and fraud prevention.  
When you register and play, the following may be collected:

* **Account data** – username, email address, password hash, login timestamps, IP addresses  
* **osu! client identifiers** – cryptographic hashes of hardware components (e.g., hard-drive / client IDs) and of the osu! client installation  
* **Game activity** – scores, performance statistics, leaderboard positions  

Processing is based on **Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR** (performance of a contract) and **Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR** (legitimate interest in security and maintaining a fair game environment).  
Server logs are retained briefly (up to 7 days) for security and then deleted or anonymised.

### 4. Accessing or Deleting Your Data  
You can **request a copy of your stored personal data** or **delete your account** at any time:

* Log in and open **Settings → Privacy / Data** to download or delete your data directly, **or**  
* Email **dev@ness.biz.id** with your username and registered email for assistance.

Account deletion removes all personal data and is irreversible.

### 5. Third-Party Services  
To provide the service we use:

* **Cloudflare** – network security, performance optimisation, and Turnstile bot protection  
* **Ko-fi** – optional donation processing (handled entirely on Ko-fi’s site)

Each provider operates under its own privacy policy and appropriate EU safeguards.

We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these Terms or applicable law.

### 8. Liability  
Service is provided “as is.” We are not liable for indirect or incidental damages such as downtime, data loss, or third-party failures, except where mandatory law applies.
